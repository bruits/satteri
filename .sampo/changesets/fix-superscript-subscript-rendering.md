`features.superscript` and `features.subscript` now render `^text^` as `<sup>text</sup>` and `~text~` as `<sub>text</sub>` as documented, instead of `<em>`. The MDAST now exposes dedicated `superscript` and `subscript` node types, which plugins can visit and construct. Plugins that previously matched these spans as `emphasis` nodes should switch to the new node types.
