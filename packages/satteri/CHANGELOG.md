# satteri

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-07

### Minor changes

- [6f380d3](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/6f380d346f9bc51d60213f84d51e3d8123f63a25) Added factory-shape support to `hastPlugins` and `mdastPlugins`: each entry can now be a function returning a plugin definition, called once per compile. This is useful for stateful plugins. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.5 — 2026-05-06

### Patch changes

- [22c4f06](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/22c4f06e8923de01a371db798dbf39022737ad33) Fixes a rare case where plugins could produce corrupted output in very specific situations. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.4 — 2026-04-30

### Patch changes

- [80d21c8](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/80d21c8b9bc7f7cb2f86c170d4fafac0d5d2a3b7) Fix a crash when an MDAST plugin returns a tree containing a directive
  (`containerDirective` / `leafDirective` / `textDirective`) and the surrounding
  document contains multi-byte text (e.g. Devanagari, CJK). — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [80d21c8](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/80d21c8b9bc7f7cb2f86c170d4fafac0d5d2a3b7) Reduced memory usage when using MDAST plugins. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.3 — 2026-04-30

### Patch changes

- [8e7642c](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/8e7642cde7aa2c1b0e0b9a7676666f2c990ca7da) Fixed compilation crashing with `invalid type: map, expected a sequence` when an MDAST plugin returned a tree containing a directive node (`containerDirective`, `leafDirective`, `textDirective`). Directive children now round-trip through plugins correctly. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.2 — 2026-04-29

### Patch changes

- [bf7c5a0](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/bf7c5a0bb9865f8147ea6b0815558df3ece0de08) Fixed SVG attributes names (e.g. `viewBox`, `fillOpacity`) being converted to lowercase when set on elements from JS plugins — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [bf7c5a0](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/bf7c5a0bb9865f8147ea6b0815558df3ece0de08) Fixed numeric property values (e.g. `width: 16`, `start: 5`) being silently dropped when set on elements from JS plugins. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-29

### Patch changes

- [467bdf9](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/467bdf9b523b1ff1f560499c4d4c769e9c888166) Fixed plugin-set `data` being lost or corrupted on MDAST and HAST nodes in certain cases. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-29

### Minor changes

- [baae3b8](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/baae3b83b56bf0fb4cd0b0d2f376627ff0267b8f) MDAST plugins can now set `data.hName`, `data.hProperties`, and `data.hChildren` on a node and have Sätteri render the corresponding HAST element, matching the rehype idiom.

  This is especially useful for rendering directives, given a `containerDirective`, an `hName` of `"aside"` and `hProperties` of `{ className: ["note"] }`, satteri will emit `<aside class="note">…</aside>`. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

### Patch changes

- [baae3b8](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/baae3b83b56bf0fb4cd0b0d2f376627ff0267b8f) Fixed a crash when an MDAST plugin called `ctx.setProperty(node, "data", …)` on certain specific node types (e.g. `paragraph`, `blockquote`, `delete`). The call now succeeds and the data round-trips through the conversion pipeline as expected. — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [baae3b8](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/baae3b83b56bf0fb4cd0b0d2f376627ff0267b8f) Fixed plugins silently dropping all but the last structural change against a given node. Multiple `insertBefore`/`insertAfter` calls on the same node, or sibling inserts paired with a `removeNode` on that same node, now all apply in the order they were issued.

  Combinations that don't have a sensible meaning, like modifying something inside a removed subtree, now report an error instead of silently dropping the change. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.8 — 2026-04-29

### Patch changes

- [1f92697](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/1f9269712ad4276bdbf8c9d2f205d8029bea7c43) Added visitor support for `containerDirective`, `leafDirective`, and `textDirective` nodes. Plugin authors can now subscribe to directive nodes directly (with typed `name`/`attributes` and children).

  Removed the `root` visitor key. Plugins should subscribe to specific node types instead; a dedicated API for prepending or appending content at the document level will land separately. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.7 — 2026-04-27

### Patch changes

- [f632abf](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/f632abf4ac516f1c8bb3fc713f8894cab9be5d8f) Various MDX parsing fixes:
  - Fixed non-ASCII content in MDX expressions/JSX inside containers (blockquotes, lists) being corrupted due to byte-by-byte char casting.
  - Fixed MDX-only paragraphs inside blockquotes not being unraveled (producing spurious `<p>` wrappers).
  - Fixed multiple JSX elements on one line only rendering the first element.
  - Multiple other cases of small inconsistencies with `@mdxjs/mdx`, notably in whitespace handling and node positions. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

- [f632abf](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/f632abf4ac516f1c8bb3fc713f8894cab9be5d8f) Added granular smart punctuation options (`ENABLE_SMART_QUOTES`, `ENABLE_SMART_DASHES`, `ENABLE_SMART_ELLIPSES`) that can be enabled independently instead of the entire group. — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [5736ca4](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/5736ca45dd3eaf703e6d573f19274b42f1ca6cb9) Fixes many output inconsistencies with remark across Markdown, GFM, and MDX parsing, mostly found by extensive property-based fuzz testing. Notable areas: GFM bare-URL detection, MDX JSX flow vs inline classification, footnote numbering and section ordering, directive label inline parsing, list spread/tight handling, and reference link spans. — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.6 — 2026-04-17

### Patch changes

- [11ffcfc](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/11ffcfca6c8486a3744e37e0c19e78100925323e) Fixed unclosed `{` in a paragraph silently consuming later blocks as an MDX expression, and fixed literal `{` inside code spans being falsely reported as an unclosed MDX expression — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.5 — 2026-04-16

### Patch changes

- [6f9f66f](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/6f9f66fa75722c0b58f50783b5ac85fefd53a157) Fixed JSX inside MDX expression bodies, JSX inside `.map()` callbacks or other expressions is now compiled to `_jsx()` calls instead of being dropped or emitted as raw JSX — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.4 — 2026-04-16

### Patch changes

- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed hyphenated JSX element names (e.g. `<my-widget>`) written explicitly in MDX being incorrectly routed through the components provider and producing invalid JavaScript — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed script and style element contents being entity-escaped, which produced invalid output (e.g. `&lt;` inside `<script>`) — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed HAST property names not being mapped to their HTML attribute names during rendering (e.g. `className` now renders as `class`, `htmlFor` as `for`) — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed source positions being dropped for most node types during mdast-to-hast conversion, so hast plugins now see accurate positions across the tree — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed code blocks missing trailing newlines when using hast plugins — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed footnote references and definitions not being rendered when using hast plugins — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed table column alignment being dropped when using hast plugins — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed `code.value` in the MDAST tree including a trailing newline for well-formed fenced code blocks, which diverged from `remark-parse`. MDAST plugins inspecting `node.value` now see the same bytes as remark. — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ef20299](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ef202996675d5e45548e34bef49da906c28a30e9) Fixed task list classes and checkbox inputs being missing when using hast plugins — Thanks @Princesseuh!

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-14

### Minor changes

- [893ef59](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/893ef59125e5969f34650ee27c919f1fae29fe62) Fix MDX import/export and expression handling to match the behavior of the original JavaScript implementation:
  - Fix `mdxjsEsm` nodes not being delivered to HAST plugin visitors
  - Fix multiline `export` blocks (e.g. objects, arrays) being truncated
  - Fix expression boundaries for edge cases involving comments, template literals, regex, and JSX
  - Report errors for unclosed MDX expressions — Thanks @Princesseuh!

### Patch changes

- [ecaeb2c](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ecaeb2ce18cbe6a7dc46d19bc49a32aa7114a2c5) Fixes browser export still bringing in Node code by accident. — Thanks @Princesseuh!
- [ecaeb2c](https://github.com/bruits/satteri/commit/ecaeb2ce18cbe6a7dc46d19bc49a32aa7114a2c5) Add position data to hast nodes. Position information was already stored in the Rust arena during mdast-to-hast conversion, but was never exposed to the JavaScript side. — Thanks @Princesseuh!
